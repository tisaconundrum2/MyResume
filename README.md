You can view your grades based on What-If scores so that you know how grades will be affected by upcoming or resubmitted assignments. You can test scores for an assignment that already includes a score, or an assignment that has yet to be graded. The changing market landscape can make it hard to keep your resume looking pretty and concise.
But at the same time it can be hard to have to go into Word with the intent of changing one thing only to have Word retilt the Earth and send everything careening into the void.

## Solution

This spectacular approach is easier, designed using all the basic rules of Bootstrap.
Create a column, create a row. Create a row within a column. It's easy.
And the best part, one can simply copy a `div` and paste it again somewhere else and add new details.
I've created ease for each new entry by simply having bootstrap do the heavy lifting when it comes to design.
