# Resume Built with Bootstrap

Designed with change in mind. 

The changing market landscape can make it hard to keep your resume looking pretty and concise.
But at the same time, Word can sometimes be frustrating when one has the intent of changing one thing only to have everything be skewed and sent careening into the void.

## The Solution

This spectacular approach is easier, designed using all the basic rules of Bootstrap.
Create a column, create a row. Create a row within a column. It's easy.
And the best part, you just simply copy a `div` and paste it again somewhere else and add new details.
I've created an easy environment in which each new entry is just one simple change. Bootstrap does all the heavy lifting and I sit back and enjoy the design.
